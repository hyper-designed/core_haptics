## 0.1.0

* **BREAKING:** Restructured native sources from separate `ios/` and `macos/` directories into a unified `darwin/` folder using Flutter's `sharedDarwinSource` convention.
* Added `ffiPlugin: true` to both iOS and macOS platform configurations in `pubspec.yaml`.
* Fixed `CoreHapticsPlugin` registrant to include `registerWith` method for proper plugin registration.
* Removed the bundled `example/` app — see the repository README for usage examples.
* Removed native Swift unit tests (`ios/Tests/`) — moved to separate test infrastructure.
* Added root `analysis_options.yaml` with `flutter_lints` and `public_member_api_docs` rule.

## 0.0.8

* Remove unused `dart:typed_data` import.

## 0.0.7

* Use stub on web/WASM, native implementation when `dart:io` is available.

* Added `supportsAdvancedHaptics` property to check if full Core Haptics API is available.
* Advanced features (`HapticEngine.create()`, patterns, players) now throw `HapticsException(notSupported)` on non-Apple platforms with a helpful message.
* Updated documentation with platform support matrix.
